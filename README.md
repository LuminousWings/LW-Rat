LW-Rat
======

Client to the LW-Server

A Remote Administration Tool client that goes along with LW-Rat. Considering the fact I don't feel the need to continue this project
I decided to share it to you. So this rat is coded in java because I was wondering if it was possible and yes, it is.
It uses a kryonet api so make sure you have that as a library.
